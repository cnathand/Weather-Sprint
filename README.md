peer review: Bronel Lazar - Everything looks good I see the forecast and everything and the temperatures, the save to favorites works as well as the recent searches. I can search for other cities, on initial load though there seems to be an image that doesnt pop up which is likely from the error in the console that cannot load "partlycloudy" and not sure how it is on the figma but next to the city name it displays country rather than state (mine does that too, i never got to fix it )
